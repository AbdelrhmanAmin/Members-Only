## Members-only

In this project, we are building an exclusive clubhouse where members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.
we used Ruby on rails for making this project. Here the members can sign in, create a post, edit the posts, and can sign out.
We used devise gem.
